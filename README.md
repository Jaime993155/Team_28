### Vision


The Hiker introduce a simple app that will be able to show several statistics for the user’s position and ambient, it will provide information about the altitude of the user, the speed of moving, position on the map, the step count and latitude/longitude using google services.

### Remarks to test our App:

* Please enable developer settings
* Set this App as Mock Location Provider: Systems -> Advanced -> Developer Options -> Debugging -> Select Mock Location App 
* Set it to None afterwards for a correct behavior of the App

### Known Limitations for Release 1:

* On the real device the LanguageIntegrationTests are failing. But the App shows the correct selected language, also on the real device. So the tests are failing but the Apps language behaviour is correct. (In the Simulator everything works correct.)
* This issue will be handled in the next Release.
